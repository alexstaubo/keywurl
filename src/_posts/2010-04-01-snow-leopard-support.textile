title: Snow Leopard support
---

Keywurl should now finally work on Snow Leopard in 64-bit mode, thanks to the brilliant work of <a href="http://github.com/nox/keywurl">Anthony Ramine</a> and <a href="http://github.com/vasi/keywurl">Dave Vasilevsky</a>.

Note that the latest version of SIMBL, which is bundled with Keywurl, *is required for this version to work on Snow Leopard in 64-bit mode*. If you already have an older version of SIMBL installed you will need to reinstall SIMBL from this package.
